# Project-Noah
This project is for an self-watering garden that uses data from light outside, the temperature and the water levels in the soil to gage when to water the plants.
Included are the files:
1. Old Project Noah Files
   Within this folder is some of my old work. This project started out as a project to keep me busy during the Quarantine of 2020 so the beginnings of the code was all over the place. The data I collected for light levels and soil water levels were instrumental in finding the final threshold files.
2. The Ark Complete
  This folder has the complete Solidworks files for the enclosure, including spots for the breadboard, Arduino Uno, LCD screen and room to put the light and tempature sensors. I am currently printing this so I don't have pictures of it printed but the completed assembly should act as an accurate rendering. I designed everything by hand and got proper M5 screws and nuts from McMaster Carr.
3. Final Project Noah With LCD
  This folder contains the whole code for the project, including the threshold values for each sensor and even a button to convert F to C if necessary. I will be updating this folder as the project gets printed.
